Works:
node.tpl.php
node--article.tpl.php

node--article.tpl.php seems to override node.tpl.php. page.tpl.php seems to provide a bunch of stuff, and node.tpl.php seems to check for page.tpl.php's existence before providing said stuff in page.tpl.php's stead.

page--node--1.tpl.php

It'll take completely over just fine, apparently ditching everything and inheriting nothing? I'm not sure if I was using it for the right content type.

Oh! Because it's a "page", it overrides "page". And "node"s override "node".

I wonder how I override a page, for a given node type? I guess that is a stupid thing to do, and I should only specify stuff in "page" that should go in every page, and maybe use <?php if?>s.
